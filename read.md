# Issues faced are:
1. Unable to integrate razorpay for milk page order payments(supposed error in razorpay library)

2. Want to implement individual table for subscriber with a hybrid subscription model where only retailer can rewrite the content of attribute “liter of milk” bought customer (whereas in generic subscription model have fixed transfer of subscribed item)
